      description: `This lesson explores three scenarios where chaplains work with people who do not have any current religious affiliation. The Pew Research Center calls these types of people religious “nones” - people who declare themselves to be either agnostic, atheist, or “nothing in particular.” Some of these religious “nones” have experienced trauma associated with religion. Others may have grown up in a religion, but grew away from their beliefs and practices in adulthood. Learners will navigate each scenario, identifying how to best serve people with adverse or indifferent reactions to spiritual care.`,
